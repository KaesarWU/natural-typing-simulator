# Natural Typing Simulator

A lightweight Python application that simulates human-like typing with natural variations in speed, rhythm, and pauses. Perfect for demonstrations, testing, or any scenario where you want automated typing to appear more natural.

## 🚀 Features

- **Human-like Typing Patterns**: Variable typing speed with natural fluctuations
- **Intelligent Pausing**: Longer pauses after sentences, medium pauses after clauses
- **Thinking Simulation**: Occasional random pauses that mimic human hesitation
- **Customizable Settings**: Adjustable words-per-minute and start delay
- **Lightweight**: Minimal resource usage and memory footprint
- **Safe & Controllable**: Real-time stop functionality and progress tracking
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- tkinter (usually included with Python)
- pyautogui

## 🔧 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/natural-typing-simulator.git
cd natural-typing-simulator
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install pyautogui
```

## 🎮 Usage

1. Run the application:
```bash
python natural_typing_simulator.py
```

2. Paste your text into the text area
3. Adjust settings (optional):
   - **Average WPM**: Typing speed (default: 50 WPM)
   - **Start Delay**: Countdown before typing begins (default: 3 seconds)
4. Click "Start Typing"
5. Quickly move your cursor to the target application
6. Watch as your text is typed out naturally!

## ⚙️ How It Works

The simulator uses sophisticated algorithms to mimic human typing patterns:

- **Variable Speed**: Typing speed fluctuates naturally around your set WPM
- **Sentence Pauses**: Longer pauses after `.`, `!`, and `?` characters
- **Clause Pauses**: Medium pauses after `,`, `;`, and `:` characters
- **Word Breaks**: Slight pauses between words
- **Thinking Moments**: Random occasional pauses (2% chance per character)

## 🛠️ Technical Details

- Built with Python and tkinter for the GUI
- Uses pyautogui for cross-platform input simulation
- Multi-threaded design keeps UI responsive during typing
- Minimal memory usage (~10-15MB RAM)

## 📝 Example Use Cases

- **Software Demos**: Make automated demonstrations look more natural
- **Testing**: Test applications that monitor typing patterns
- **Accessibility**: Assist users with typing difficulties
- **Education**: Demonstrate proper typing rhythm and pacing
- **Content Creation**: Automate typing for videos or streams

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- Ensure you have cursor focus in the target application before typing starts
- The stop button immediately halts all typing activity
- Test with small texts first to familiarize yourself with the timing
- Some applications may have security measures that block automated input

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Typing doesn't start?**
- Make sure your cursor is in the target application
- Check that pyautogui is properly installed
- Some applications may block automated input

**Installation issues?**
- Ensure you have Python 3.6 or newer
- On Linux, you may need to install tkinter separately
- Some systems require additional permissions for automation
